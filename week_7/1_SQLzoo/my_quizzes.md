### Reflection

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
	My strategy was to fully understand each of the concepts.  This worked fairly well but it lead to lots of random research that was based on far more complex problems.  I mostly faced the problem of, my head being filled with new information about the research on each subunit of the tutorials.
What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I had a lot of questions due to this being new information.  I used w3 schools mostly.
What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
I am having the most trouble with the subq's.  I figured out that they are really syntax dependent.
Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
	A plethora of them.  I have never used sql before.
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
  I am somewhat confident with the information.
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
  Learning a new subject and having the language being really user friendly, albiet redundant, was fun.
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  Leaning the new syntax.
