## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
one to one is a relationship of a dog/pet to a family.  The family can still be a family without a pet but if their is a pet that pet can only be that families pet.

the many to many I chose to work with was a buy and seller relationship that involves a storefront.  The buyer could buy many items and the seller could sell to many customers and the inventory can be many different items and quantity threshholds etc.

## Release 5: Reflection

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
	The only problem I faced was trying to make a table by holding down the mouse button and making a square.  I used the attached documentation to figure out how to fix the mistake.
What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
	I wanted more information on the nature of the relationships that were defined.  I used google and a couple different sites from the search "what is the nature of (type of relationship) relationships in sql".  
What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something 
out? If so, what?
	The only real trouble I was having in this was using a new tool with a new designer.  I figured out that the documentation is a wonderful resource.
Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
	Yes.  I learned how to create tables / add rows/columns / give those rows/columns attributes/sizes etc / also how to link tables and why.
How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
	Somewhat.
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
	Learning something new (sql design tool)
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	Not being able to get the table created at first.
