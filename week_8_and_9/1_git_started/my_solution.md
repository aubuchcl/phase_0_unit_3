## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add <br>
moves the changes to the staging area.  <br>

#### branch <br>
command that allows for general purpose changes to the branch as a whole, or to create a new branch<br>

#### checkout <br>
a way to navigate between branches

#### clone <br>
creates a copy to your computer of an existing directory

#### commit <br>
takes all staged items and makes them a permenant part of the history

#### fetch <br>
if you want to add a branch from another repository to your current repository fetch will allow you to download said branch without merging simultaniously.  This allows time for inspection.

#### log <br>
lets you take a look at previous revisions of the project.  Also allows for a couple of format options.


#### merge <br>
somewhat the opposite of branch.  I think of the branch/merge relationship as a small fake christmas tree.  When you branch is like taking the tree out and unfolding its branches.  When you merge its like folding it back up so it fits in the box.


#### pull <br>
pull does the same thing as fetch but instead of giving you time to inspect it just merges the new branch automatically.


#### push<br>
Allows you to contribute your branch to another repository


#### reset <br>
this is the unsafe way to undo changes to the repository and should only be used locally.



#### rm<br>
Removes files fromt he index or from the working tree and the index.

#### status<br>
works to show what is in the working directory and what is in the staged snapshot.  


## Release 3: Git Workflow<br>
git push "remote" "branch"  <br>
- Push files to a remote repository <br>
git fetch "remote" <br>
- Fetch changes <br>
git commit <br>
- Commit locally <br>

Reflection <br>

My strategy was to work through this item by item.  I had questions about exactly how these commands worked together and mostly used gitref.org.  I am having trouble wrapping my head around the entire range of options that git has to offer, but I am sure it will make more sense as I use it more.  I also wonder if this is more efficient than using the application, but I am sure that if we are learning it then it is.  I learned lots of new skills and tricks, but I am not 100% confident with most of them.  I did enjoy learning about how many options there really are in git.  It was tedious to try and express my own ideas about these definitions.
