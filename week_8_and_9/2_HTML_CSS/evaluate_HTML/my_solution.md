> <!-- ## Evaluate a Website! 
 
> 1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
> it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
> it doesnt declare a doctype or what type of HTML it is working with.
> should have put something like <DOCTYPE! HTML>
 
> 2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 
> I dont mind the way they did all of their tables.  They tagged by a clever naming structure and followed mostly best practices.

> Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

> I like the way they did TD or TR as a table row or table data marker for their css markup.
 
> 3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
> separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
>  They did almost all of the formatting via css.  Other than the idea that they created the format of their table structure in html.
> 4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
> If so, what?
>  not sure what "href="vote?for=7730311&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%6e%65%77%73"" is or what it means.
> 5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
> they organized by making sure all of their data was inline with the same style of change for the next row it seemed pretty dry.
 
> 6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
>   filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix(M11=-1, M12=0, M21=0, M22=-1, DX=0, DY=0, SizingMethod='auto expand');
> i think that this is what made the site responsive or at least what helped it work on certain browsers.  I dont exactly understand what it did.
 
> 7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
> what you've read?
>  I think it might be a little more in depth than what I am used to working with.  It seems like it was well thought out so that they had an exact idea of what they were tying to complete before they started.  Otherwise it would have ended up being a mess.

>  Reflect

> What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
> 	My strategy was to get all the required docs into the appropriate files and then read over them and answer the questions.  This worked ok.  I faced some problems when trying to fully understand some of the code.
> What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
> 	I answered most of my questions by separating the code into a worksheet file and playing with it.
> What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
> 	Not sure how I would approach this project, it is a much bigger file than I am used to seeing.
> Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
>   Using google chrometools snappysnippit.
> How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
>   Mostly
> Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
>   Looking at a big project.
> Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
>   Trying to understand the file.
