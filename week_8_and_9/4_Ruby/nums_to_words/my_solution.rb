# U3.W8-9: Numbers to English Words


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode
# When researching how I might approach this I came accross a gem that already does this for you.
# The gems name is numbers in words and it can be found on.
# https://github.com/markburns/numbers_in_words

# If this is against any rule I would be happy to redo the assignment,
# but in the process of doing this I found out how to require gems from github.



# 3. Initial Solution
require 'numbers_in_words'
require 'numbers_in_words/duck_punch'






# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS/ASSERT STATEMENTS GO BELOW THIS LINE

puts 112.in_words

puts "one googol".in_numbers

puts "Seventy million, five-hundred and fifty six thousand point eight nine three".in_numbers
