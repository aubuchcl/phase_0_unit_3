	Hunter and I were both relatively new to creating and manipulating a db from scratch.<br>  It was easier to follow the directions than we had anticipated and we learned a lot of new things, like (don't misspell customer)<br>
	Overall I would say that we are both relatively comfortable with SQL and the challenges we have completed so far.  <br>
	When we were stuck we mainly used google for quick fixes or referenced the week 7 material.<br>
	The most fun part of this challenge was coming up with the different emails for the users we entered into our db.<br>
	It was tedious to make sure that everything was perfect before going to the next line knowing that mis-entering data meant redoing the insert/value.
